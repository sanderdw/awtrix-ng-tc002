# ---- numbers ---------------------------------------------------------------
# num(v) turns a value that ought to be a number into one, or returns the
# default (nil unless given). It exists because the obvious check does not
# work: Berry's isinstance() takes an instance and a class, but ints and reals
# are primitives and `int`/`real` are the baselib conversion FUNCTIONS -- so
# isinstance(876.6, real) is quietly false and a script that guards with it
# drops every value it receives. type() is the primitive-safe test, and this
# helper is the one place that has to know that.
#
# Accepted: ints and reals (returned as-is), strings holding a bare JSON
# number ("876.6"), and strings holding a JSON-quoted number ("\"876.6\"" --
# what a broker publishing string-typed states emits). Everything else --
# units ("876.6 W"), decimal commas ("876,6"), maps, bools, garbage -- yields
# the default. json.load is the parser on purpose: it is strict, and a strict
# nil beats number()'s silent 0-for-garbage and 876-for-"876,6".
# round/clamp/min/max are the arithmetic every second script hand-rolls, so
# they live here once. round() is half-away-from-zero -- what a human reading
# a sensor value expects -- via int()'s truncation toward zero, so it needs no
# math import. clamp/min/max compare with < only, so they work on anything
# Berry can order, strings included.
