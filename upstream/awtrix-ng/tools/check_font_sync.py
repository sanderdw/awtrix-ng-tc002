"""Checks that the generated panel fonts match the BDF sources.

src/media/AwtrixFont.h is generated: both panel fonts laid out as glyph tables
and index arrays over one shared bitmap blob. Nothing in the normal build
regenerates it, so a stale header fails quietly rather than loudly:

1. An edit to a BDF under assets/fonts/ does not reach the device. The firmware
   keeps drawing the previously generated glyphs, so a redrawn letter still looks
   the way it did - while the source that was "obviously" changed sits right
   there in the tree.

2. A change to the covered ranges desynchronises the index arrays from the
   FontRange table. Out-of-range entries are caught by test_font, but an entry
   that merely points at the wrong glyph is not: it draws a plausible letter.

3. Glyph slots shift. Code points that draw the same pixels share a slot, so one
   redrawn glyph can renumber every index after it - in both fonts at once,
   because they share the blob.

Fix a failure with:

    python scripts/gen_font.py

and commit the regenerated header.

Run: python tools/check_font_sync.py
