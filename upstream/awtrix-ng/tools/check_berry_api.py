"""Checks the web UI editor's generated Berry API table.

Two failures this catches, both of which are silent otherwise:

1. The extraction patterns in scripts/berry_api.py stopped matching -- after a
   refactor moves a registration, renames a file, or reformats a call. The build
   would still succeed and the editor would just quietly lose its highlighting
   and completion, which reads as a styling choice rather than a broken build.

2. The table checked into webui/index.html is stale. The build regenerates it in
   place, so a commit that adds a binding without building leaves the simulator
   -- which serves that file straight from disk -- offering an API that no longer
   matches the firmware.

Run: python tools/check_berry_api.py
