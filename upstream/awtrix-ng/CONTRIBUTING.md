# Contributing to AWTRIX NG

Thanks for being here. Issues and pull requests are both welcome, and you do not
need hardware to contribute — a host simulator runs the real firmware on your
computer.

By contributing you agree that your contribution is licensed under the project's
[PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSE.md), and you additionally grant
Stephan Mühl (Blueforcer) a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and
transferable right to use, modify and relicense your contribution under other
terms, including commercial ones. You keep the copyright in what you wrote.

Why: the project offers commercial licenses on request, and a license it cannot
grant over every line of the code is worth nothing. Without this you would have
to be asked individually for every such request, forever.

## What is most useful right now

In rough order of value:

1. **On-device test reports.** AWTRIX 2 conversions and DIY panels, a real MQTT
   broker, a real Home Assistant instance — the boards and setups development
   does not run on every day. Say what you ran, what you expected and what
   happened.
2. **Berry scripts worth shipping as examples.**
3. **Bug reports with a reproduction** — a `curl` command beats a description.
4. **Documentation fixes.** Every page is meant to describe what the code
   actually does; a page that promises something the firmware does not do is a
   bug, not a wish.

## Setting up

You need [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and Python 3.12+:

```bash
pip install -U platformio
```

Node 22+ is needed for a firmware build (the web UI is minified through `npx`
before it is embedded) and for the web UI tests.

## The four build targets

```bash
pio run  -e awtrix        # ESP32 firmware (stock pin defaults)
pio run  -e awtrix_s3_octal     # ESP32-S3 firmware, octal PSRAM
pio run  -e awtrix_s3_quad      # ESP32-S3 firmware, quad PSRAM
pio test -e native        # host unit tests for the portable core
pio run  -e native_sim    # host simulator: full firmware + web UI, no hardware
```

The simulator is the fastest loop. Build it, run
`.pio/build/native_sim/program`, and open <http://localhost:8080> — the web UI's
live preview stands in for the panel, and the script engine, its editor, MQTT
and the HTTP API all behave as they do on the device.

## What CI gates on

Every push runs, and your PR needs all of it green:

```bash
pio test -e native                     # host unit tests
pio run -e awtrix                      # both firmware images build
pio run -e awtrix_s3_octal
python tools/check_docs_sync.py        # docs match the firmware's real fields
python tools/check_berry_api.py        # editor's Berry API table is current
python tools/gen_agent_skill.py --check
python tools/check_prelude_solidified.py
python tools/check_font_sync.py
python tools/check_partitions.py
mkdocs build --strict                  # docs build, no broken links or anchors
cd webui/test && npm install && npm test
```

### Generated files you may have to regenerate

Several checked-in files are produced by generators that **no normal build
runs**, which is exactly why the checks above exist — a stale one fails
silently on the device instead of loudly at build time.

| If you changed… | Regenerate with |
|---|---|
| `src/core/script/Prelude.h`, or a binding name in `ScriptBindings.cpp` | `python scripts/gen_prelude_solidified.py` |
| a BDF under `assets/fonts/` | `python scripts/gen_font.py` |
| `webui/index.html`, or added a Berry binding | any `pio run -e awtrix*` (the pre-script regenerates the embedded asset and the editor's API table in place) |
| `scripts/gen_partitions.py` | nothing — `check_partitions.py` regenerates and validates every table |

Commit the regenerated file together with the change that caused it.

## Code style

There is no formatter config, on purpose: the tree is consistent and a
reformatting commit would bury real changes. **Match the surrounding code.**

The load-bearing rules:

- **`src/core/` stays portable.** No Arduino, no FastLED, no board headers, no
  `#ifdef` on a chip. That is what makes it unit-testable on the host, and CI's
  `native` build is what enforces it. Hardware belongs behind the seams in
  `src/hal/` and `src/system/`.
- **Comment what the code cannot say itself.** Names and small functions still
  carry most of the explanation, so don't restate a signature in words. Leave a
  short `//` note above a function or a dense block when a reader would
  otherwise have to reverse-engineer the intent — an invariant, a unit, a wire
  format, or the hardware quirk being worked around. One line is usually enough,
  two is the limit. No Doxygen, no banners, no commented-out code. The reasoning
  behind a *change* still belongs in its commit message and pull request, where
  it stays readable and dated.
- **New behaviour comes with a host test** in `test/`, unless it genuinely
  cannot run off-device.
- **The docs are part of the change.** A new field, endpoint or setting lands in
  `docs/` in the same PR — `check_docs_sync.py` will tell you if you forgot.

## Commits and pull requests

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — one logical
change per commit, present tense, and say *why* in the body when the *what* is
not self-evident:

```
fix(mqtt): publish state as soon as power or an indicator changes
feat(http): reject bodies over 8 KB with 413 instead of a bogus 400
docs(reference): correct the default scroll hold
```

Common scopes: `http`, `mqtt`, `render`, `script`, `webui`, `audio`, `device`,
`docs`, `ci`, `build`.

For the PR itself: describe what changed and how you verified it. If you tested
on hardware, say which board. If you only tested in the simulator, say that too
— it is useful information, not an admission.
